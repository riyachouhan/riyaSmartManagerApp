<h4>Consolidated Approaches</h4>
<p>Phase 1</p>
<p>We aim for $10 Million USD as PRE DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL RAISING</p>
The Goals for raising this amount are:
<ul>
    <li>Continue with THE SMART ASSET MANAGERS WALLET feature developments. The wallet as a currency storage facility to begin with, will be an ongoing development, where all OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY SAM WILL BE IN THE WALLET APPS</li>
    <li>Register Smart Asset Managers in the Philippines both in the Fee Port Economic Zone, acquire local registration of the SAM wallet thru an endorsed way thru the Central Bank of the Philippines</li>
    <li>Register all SAM Wallet Development Projects Globally as when we have the operations. SAM is not intending to launch any new coin nor plans to launch its own coin. Utilizing the opportunities in DDK platform the technological advances of DDK is way ahead blockchain service in the market including Bitcoin and Ethereum. So the opportunity in both SAM and DDK is enormous.</li>
    <li>SAM will be engaged in multitude of conventional businesses around the world with using only the loan capital from the participants as a leverage and or collateral/guarantee of funds in its business engagements. It only means that almost all of the funds generated will not be actively invested outside of the SAM wallet.</li>
    <li>In Phase 2 development, SAM will start its asset procurement.  This will  strengthen SAM’s  financial position as it will have a tangible asset in terms of physical asset and free hold interests in conventional business that will secure all loaned finances to SAM by its participants.</li>
    <li>All of SAM’s conventional business interests and physical properties including precious metals, real estate and intellectual properties will be in favor of SAM where the primary interested properties will be its CREDITORS.</li>
    <li>Phase 3 of SAM Capital raising -- we intend to go to the stock market. Where the primary beneficiaries of SAM privileges will be the phase 1 participants.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>CONVENTIONAL BUSINESSES SAM WALLET BE ENGAGED</b> -- where we will source to fund the average monthly rewards program that will be distributed on a daily basis.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only 5-10% of SAM Interest will go to trading opportunities using the Jonny Blockchain Robotic Arbitrage</li>
    <li>SAM will maximize the global reseller contract with RIX of Switzerland, where Rix is a marketing brand and ad agency offering a wide array of promotional campaign and one of them is free flight vouchers. </li>
</ul>

<p>SAM Reseller contracts are within the regions of <i>Australia</i>, <i>Philippines</i>, <i>New Zealand</i>, <i>USA</i>, <i>Canada</i>. <i>Japan</i> and soon <i>Malaysia</i>, <i>Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore</i>. As a matter of global marketing interest, SAM registered a website called www.freeflighvouchers.com, where it will cater to various industries like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Dental Teeth Whitening</li>
    <li>Dental Finance</li>
    <li>Retail shop promotional campaign</li>
    <li>Dental Routine Preventative check up</li>
    <li>Discounting Program membership</li>
    <li>Merchants discounting program memberships</li>
    <li>Scratch vouchers</li>
    <li>Future prospects of SAM buying and owning multiple dental practices as part of its phase 3 program acquisition system in preparation for the stock market listing as SAM Digital Technologies, where the members greatly benefit</li>
    <li>Inviting merchants to list their products and services in SAM Stores</li>
</ul>
<p>SAM WILL MAXIMIZE ITS POTENTIAL IN INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL TRADING PARTNERSHIPS</p>
<ul>
    <li>Partnership in import and export of petroleum products directly from seller/refineries and sold directly to global local buyers</li>
    <li>In the Philippines, wholesale to retail opportunities where we can directly sell to local resellers and all DDK wallet holders at a discounted price directly to pump. In reality, this is a very small income opportunities, where the hundred of millions of income here will come from the direct wholesale, where volume matters most and DDK consumer participation is significant. Costco in Australia is doing it successfully, as it is. And on top, owning our reseller store of discounted fuel will add to our tangible assets and liquidity for daily DDK liquidations</li>
    <li>Philippines’ local partnering for global trading of fish and other frozen commodities, working on income sharing opportunity is one factor. And the other opportunities is offering business opportunities to less fortunate people that have the business acumen but lack financial capital. Starting with local reselling of fish and other frozen food will open the gateway of opportunities for people that will partner with SAM as members only and merchants provider selling directly to open community regardless whether they are or not members of SAM network, for as long as the SAM merchants will transact their daily payouts in DDK as payment of commodities taken on consignment basis.</li>
    <li>Merchants Finance system -- where SAM will offer local partnerships with SAM businesses and offering referral rewards for memberships in exchange of significantly discounted mainstream household products using the leverage of bulk buying discounts where discounts are passed thru directly to consumers. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>In Phase 3 Development</b> -- All SAM Development Project will be listed in the Global Stock Markets. where all our incomes will flow like water coming out of the TAP. The primary beneficiaries are those who will trust this project from Phase 1, being the High Risk SAM Pre Development Capital Raising. 
        SAM’s Program is not on the number of people that will register and receive the rewards Program. It is on the capital raised and to use as a leverage into partnering with real conventional businesses that will generate real fiat income. The very reason why we cannot keep going onto paying the 15%, level commission 1-5, 7% and the 2% monthly. If we keep in doing this, we will never sustain. Doing it the conventional basic way will guarantee its longevity where everyone will get paid what is due them. All those who will initially take the risk will get rewarded accordingly.</p>
