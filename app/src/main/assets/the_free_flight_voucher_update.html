<h4>The Free Flight Vouchers UPDATE</h4>

<p>Free Flight Vouchers, is one of the conventional businesses in the SMART ASSET MANAGERS PROJECT DEVELOPMENTS (POOLING). Free Flight Vouchers in SAM Project Developments has multiple sub-categories which are income-generating categories.</p>

<p>Let me first explain briefly what is free flight vouchers.</p>

<p>FREE FLIGHT VOUCHER IS NOT FOR SALE FOR PERSONAL OR GROUP TRAVEL PURPOSES. IT IS DESIGNED AS AN ANJUNCT OR SUPPLEMENTAL APPROACH FOR MARKETING CAMPAIGN PURPOSES OF COMPANIES. THEREFORE, STRICT AND SPECIFIC GUIDELINES ARE IN PLACE.</p>

<p><strong>HOW WILL IT ALL WORK?</strong></p>

<p>Free Flight Vouchers will create a tool to drive the campaign marketing. A website called www.freeflightvouchers.com will be created to contain the different marketing campaigns of all merchant members. The website is purely for marketing and informational purposes only. A separate website for each individual campaign will be created for specific campaign on the discretion of RIX Group.</p>

<p>Every country where Free Flight vouchers runs its campaign, will be properly registered.</p>

<p>RIX Group will be invoicing Free Flight Vouchers for all the bulk vouchers.</p>

<p>Free Flight Vouchers Australia PTY LTD understands and accepts that there are specific redemption process in place for the free flight vouchers offered by RIX Group.</p>

<p>Free Flight Vouchers Australia PTY LTD is in itself a company that will run its own campaign on top of the merchants and consumer membership programs.</p>

<p>Countries with interests in reselling Free Flight Voucher are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Australia</li>
    <li>New Zealand</li>
    <li>Philippines</li>
    <li>USA</li>
    <li>Hong Kong</li>
    <li>Malaysia</li>
    <li>Middle East</li>
</ul>

<p>SAM went into partnership with a marketing company from the UK. This company is focused in branding marketing and one of the highlights is the flight vouchers.</p>

<p>The approach is that the marketing company promotes the free flight vouchers as part of the marketing company for companies promoting products and services. The free flight vouchers is not being marketed as a travel agency selling airfare tickets. This is mainly promotional campaign only with specific redemption process. Because of the nature of the bulk buying system for free flight vouchers, the redemption process must be followed accordingly, as there is a forfeiture of the free flight vouchers during redemption. Do Not Be Alarmed though, because the process is very simple. So again, the Free Flight Vouchers is used as a Marketing Campaign Approach bundled with products and or services for company running a marketing campaign for promotional and branding purposes, not as a mode of specifically buying an airline tickets. The Good News is when free flight vouchers is in a bundle. It is rewarded with all taxes and surcharges paid and not as a raffle promotion.</p>

<p>SAM Projects Developments is projecting a $30M -$50 Million United States Dollar Revenue for the Global marketing of Free Flight Vouchers using a multi sub- category strategies:</p>
