</ul>
<p>The SAM Opportunities will run on batch system: </p>

<ul>
    <li>High Risk up to $10M raised</li>
    <li>Main Lender receives up to 15% monthly rewards. </li>
    <li>Paid in DDKoin </li>
    <li>INITIAL minimum of $300 USD as Starting Capital </li>
    <li>High Risk Program</li>
    <li>You lend a minimum of $300 USD to SAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. </li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Equivalent of whether fiat currency or acceptable currencies to lend to SAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS will be exchanged to DDK: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Depending on the conventional business daily activities, your reward entitlements could vary anywhere from 6% - 15% monthly rewards with 15% as the maximum every month. </li>
    <li>Your reward entitlements will be paid daily in DDK and calculated as 0.5% multiplied by 30 days being the 15% total for the whole month. </li>
    <li>All rewards will be paid in DDKOIN ONLY </li>
    <li>Rewards are calculated by way of $300 USD multiplied by 15% for the month. A reward is NOT PAID based on the NUMBER OF DDKOIN LENT TO SAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS rewards program received. It is based on the FIAT CURRENCY CONVERSION TO A NUMBER OF DDKOIN AND OTHER SAM ACCEPTABLE CRYPTO CURRENCIES. </li>
    <li>The reason for this reward system setup is that rewards program distributed will come from conventional businesses that receive fiat currency income and this will be eventually exchanged to DDKoin. </li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, if the price of DDK shoots up, the rewards must be distributed in fiat currency converted to DDKoin not the other way around, as the rewards system will not sustain if rewards are distributed based on the number of DDKoin lent to SAM Development Projects. </p>
<p>REFERRAL REWARDS INCENTIVES MODEL </p>
<p>
Level 1 -  Receives 10% DDKoin reward from the average 15% DDKoin reward of your referral <br>
Level 2 - Receives 5% DDKoin reward from the average 15% DDKoin reward of your referral <br>
Level 3 - Receives 2% DDKoin reward from the average 15% DDKoin reward of your referral <br>
Level 4 - Receives 2% DDKoin reward from the average 15% DDKoin reward of your referral <br>
Level 5 - Receives 5% DDKoin reward from the average 15% DDKoin reward of your referral </p>

<p>All Rewards Program Are Paid Daily with DDKOIN </p>

<p>PHASE 2 Medium-Risk Program after the $10 Million Pre-Development Capital Raising Up to $101 Million USD</p>

<p>You lend a minimum of $300 USD to SAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. Equivalent of whether fiat currency or acceptable currencies to lend to SAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS will be exchanged to DDK. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Depending on the conventional business daily activities, the reward entitlement is 7% as the maximum every month. </li>
    <li>Your reward entitlements will be paid daily in DDK and calculated as 0.2333 % multiplied by 30 days being the 7% total for the whole month </li>
    <li>All rewards will be paid in DDKOIN ONLY </li>
    <li>Rewards are calculated by way of $300 USD multiplied by 7% for the month. A reward is NOT PAID based on the NUMBER OF DDKOIN LENT TO SAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS rewards received. It is based on the FIAT CURRENCY CONVERSION TO A NUMBER OF DDKOIN AND OTHER SAM ACCEPTABLE CRYPTO CURRENCIES. </li>
    <li>The reason for this reward system setup is that rewards program distributed will come from conventional businesses that receive fiat currency income and this will be eventually exchanged to DDKoin. Therefore, if the price of DDK shoots up, the rewards must be distributed in fiat currency converted to DDKOIN not the other way around as the rewards system will not sustain if rewards are distributed based on the number of DDKoin lent to SAM Development Projects.</li>
</ul>


<p>In Phase 2 PRE DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL RAISING, there will be no Level or Referral Rewards Programs to be distributed, except for the main lender/participant who will lend a minimum of $300 to SAM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. </p>

<p>Note: All Potential Balance of Income from the SAM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS will be distributed to the original lender of Phase 1 by way of dividends.</p>

<p>For example, we only distribute 7% to Phase 2 lenders/participants, therefore from the original Phase 1 lenders, where 15% is distributed, there is a balance of potential income of 8%. This 8% will be distributed to Phase 1 lenders/participants </p>

<p>Phase 2 - lenders/participants will no longer receive the level 1-5 referral rewards program. All of the Level 1-5 potential income will be distributed to Phase 1 lenders/participants </p>

<p>Note: All future loans including Phase 1 and Phase 2 will only receive rewards distribution based on the current Rates of referral rewards at the time of lending contracts. </p>

<p>Meaning no more 15% to be distributed in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 lender and participant. </p>

<p>No more referral level rewards will be distributed in Phase 1 and Phase 2 after SAM REACHES THE FIRST $10M Pre-Development capital raising. </p>

<p>PHASE 3 – Low-Risk Program after the $101  Million Pre-Development Capital Raised and beyond.</p>

<p>You lend a minimum $300 USD to SAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. </p>

<p>Equivalent of fiat currency or any other acceptable currencies to lend to SAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS will be exchanged to DDK. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Depending on the conventional business daily activities the rewards entitlement is 2% as the maximum monthly. </li>
    <li>Your reward entitlements will be paid weekly in DDK and calculated as 2% divided by 30 days being 0.0667 total for the whole month. </li>
</ul>

<p>In Phase 3 of SMART ASSET MANAGER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, all lent assets to SAM are backed up by Guarantee from SAM ASSETS AND SAVINGS</p>

<p>This is it for now.</p>

<p>Happy lending to everyone.</p>

<p>Good Luck to us all!</p>
